Because my usual notes are organized in the Evernote software, which can share the content by sharing links, so it is very convenient to use external_link, and transfer notes is a huge project, and it is not convenient to organize and categorize here, In the future, I may purchase a domain name and server and build a personal homepage with tools like WordPress to make it easier to categorize. Even used to replace the Evernote, in order to share more easily.
