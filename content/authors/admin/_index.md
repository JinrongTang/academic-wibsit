Iâ€™m a PhD student specializing in insect biochemistry and toxicology in Institute of Plant Protection Chinese Academy of Agricultrual Sciences. I received my BA of Engineering in Pharmaceutical Engineering and Master of Agriculture in agricultural entomology and pest control from College of Plant Protection Henan Agriculture University in 2017 and 2020, respectively. I am broadly interested in the area of biochemistry and toxicology, integrated pest management. My current research lies at the pest resistance to Bt, I am working on evaluate resistance risk and molecular mechanism of pests to Bt. In the future, I would like to learn novel technologies and ideas, broaden my horizons step by step, do more in-depth and interesting research, and tell a complete scientific story to contribute to the exploration and explanation of nature, as well as the production and ecological friendly green agriculture.
