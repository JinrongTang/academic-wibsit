abstract: "Herbivore insect saliva plays an important role in the co-evolution of insects and host plants. For insect saliva, some saliva components, like elicitors, can be identified by the host plant and induce the defense response system of plant, while some saliva compounds like effectors suppress the plant defense response to facilitate the survival and development of insects. In this article, we described the latest research progress of some insect saliva elicitors and effectors that play a crucial role in the interaction of phytophagous insects and host plants, and the application prospects of these insect saliva components in pest control was also discussed in the review."
