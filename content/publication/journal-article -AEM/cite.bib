    abstract = { To improve the efficiency of production of a single toxin in crops and to delay the evolution of insect resistance to the toxin, the second generation of Bt cotton, expressing Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab, was introduced. Understanding the mode action of the Cry proteins in the insect midgut and the mechanisms insects use to overcome these toxins plays a crucial role in developing measures to counter them. Midgut receptors play a critical role in the specificity of Cry toxins for individual insect species. Cadherin proteins are essential putative receptors of Cry1A toxins in lepidopteran larvae. Cry2A family members share common binding sites in Helicoverpa armigera, and one of them, Cry2Aa, has been widely reported to interact with midgut cadherin. Here, we studied the binding interaction and functional role of H. armigera cadherin in the mechanism of Cry2Ab toxicity. A region spanning from cadherin repeat 6 (CR6) to the membrane-proximal region (MPR) of cadherin protein was produced as six overlapping peptides to identify the specific binding regions of Cry2Ab. Binding assays showed that Cry2Ab binds nonspecifically to peptides containing CR7 and CR11 regions in a denatured state but binds specifically only to CR7-containing peptides in the native state. The peptides CR6-11 and CR6-8 were transiently expressed in Sf9 cells to assess the functional role of cadherin. Cytotoxicity assays showed that Cry2Ab is not toxic to the cells expressing any of the cadherin peptides. However, ABCA2-expressing cells showed high sensitivity to Cry2Ab toxin. Neither increased nor decreased sensitivity to Cry2Ab was observed when the peptide CR6-11 was coexpressed with the ABCA2 gene in Sf9 cells. Instead, treating ABCA2-expressing cells with a mixture of Cry2Ab and CR6-8 peptides resulted in significantly reduced cell death compared with treatment with Cry2Ab alone. Moreover, silencing of the cadherin gene in H. armigera larvae showed no significant effect on Cry2Ab toxicity, in contrast to the reduced mortality in ABCA2-silenced larvae. IMPORTANCE To improve the efficiency of production of a single toxin in crops and to delay the evolution of insect resistance to the toxin, the second generation of Bt cotton, expressing Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab, was introduced. Understanding the mode action of the Cry proteins in the insect midgut and the mechanisms insects use to overcome these toxins plays a crucial role in developing measures to counter them. Extensive studies have been conducted on the receptors of Cry1A toxins, but relatively little has been done about those of Cry2Ab. By showing the nonfunctional binding of cadherin protein with Cry2Ab, we have furthered the understanding of Cry2Ab receptors. }
